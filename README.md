# Stefan's Quiz

## Introduction 
Welcome to my Quiz. My name is Stefan Jovanovic, I am a front-end-developer.

## About
The quiz is made by some random questions which everyone should now... The quiz has 4 answers but only one is correct!! 

## About structure and features
The quiz has a count for all the correct answers and also for every wrong it decreases IF it is above 0 ( I didn't want to make them feel bad for going in MINUS ), I am planning on adding the timer, so that whenever a certain amount of time passed they wont be able to answer and lose one point!
The technologies used are: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
